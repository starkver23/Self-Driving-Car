# Self-Driving-Car


Hey there! it's Aryan Verma this side. 
Today I will be talking about my first project which I made for my college subject. 
This project is based on Automatic cars. 
This project is a self driving obstacle avoiding car. 
The tools used in this car are Arduino uno, l293d motor driver, ultrasonic sensor(model: HC-SR04), servo motor, 200 rpm dual shaft gear motor, wheels and some wire and jumpers. 
The main objective was to create a car which can ease human life. 
According to a report around 90% of road accident happens due to human error, this car can reduce the level of road accidents as well as the death ratio. 
I will be adding some more cool features in this car and yeah you all are open to write some improvement's points on this car. 
This will boost me up and help me in making more projects like this.
